# Android vendor_boot Patcher and vbmeta Remaker

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This project is for educational purposes ONLY.**

Modifying your device's boot images carries significant risks, including but not limited to, bricking your device, data loss, or voiding your warranty. The author **assumes no liability** and is not responsible for any **damage or consequence** that may occur to **your device or anyone else's device** from using these scripts.

**You are solely responsible for any consequences. Use at your own absolute risk.**

This set of scripts automates the process of region code conversion for `vendor_boot.img` and remaking the corresponding `vbmeta.img`. It also provides an option to patch the `boot.img` with **KernelSU Next** to enable root.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must provide the following files from your device's stock firmware:

* `vbmeta.img`
* `vendor_boot.img`
* `boot.img` (if you want to root)

Place these files in the main directory alongside the scripts. All other dependencies (like Python, `magiskboot`, and signing keys) will be downloaded automatically.

## How to Use

1.  **Place Images:** Put your `vendor_boot.img` and `vbmeta.img` (and `boot.img` if rooting) files into the root folder.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the `install.bat` script first. This will download and set up all the necessary tools and keys.
3.  **Run the Script:**
    * To convert `vendor_boot` only, run `convert.bat`.
    * To **add root** during the process, run `convert_with_root.bat`.
4.  **Flash the Images:** Once the script is finished, new `.img` files will be ready in the `output` folder. You can now flash these to your device using `fastboot`.

## Script Descriptions

* **`info.bat`**: Drag & drop `.img` file(s) to see AVB information.
* **`install.bat`**: Checks for required tools and keys, and downloads them if they are missing.
* **`convert.bat`**: The main script. It handles the region code conversion and remakes the `vbmeta.img` **without** adding root.
* **`convert_with_root.bat`**: An alternative to the main script. It first patches the `boot.img` with **KernelSU Next** and then runs the conversion and remaking process.
